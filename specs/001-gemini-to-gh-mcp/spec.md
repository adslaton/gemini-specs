# Feature Specification: Integrate GitHub Remote MCP

**Feature Branch**: `001-gemini-to-gh-mcp`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "integrate gh remote mcp"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be a part of every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using Gemini CLI, I want to integrate with the GitHub Remote MCP to access and interact with code in GitHub repositories.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Gemini CLI is not configured to use GitHub MCP, **When** I provide a GitHub repository URL that requires MCP, **Then** I should be prompted to configure the GitHub MCP server.
2. **Given** I have configured the GitHub MCP server, **When** I provide a GitHub repository URL that requires MCP, **Then** Gemini CLI should be able to access the repository.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the MCP server is unavailable?
- How does the system handle incorrect MCP server credentials?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST integrate with the GitHub Remote MCP.
- **FR-002**: System MUST handle authentication with the MCP server.
- **FR-003**: System MUST use the MCP integration to access repository data.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear feedback on the status of the MCP integration.
- **FR-005**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific authentication methods supported by the MCP? (e.g., tokens, OAuth)]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **GitHub MCP Server Configuration**: Represents the settings for the MCP server, including its address and credentials.
