# Research: Integrate GitHub Remote MCP

**Date**: 2025-09-24

## Research Summary
This document outlines the decisions made to resolve the `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` items in the implementation plan for integrating the GitHub Remote MCP.

## Decisions

### Authentication Method

*   **Decision**: Token-based authentication will be used.
*   **Rationale**: This is a common and secure method for API authentication. It is flexible and allows for easy revocation of access.
*   **Alternatives considered**: OAuth was considered, but it adds unnecessary complexity for a CLI tool where the user can be expected to generate a token manually.

### Technology Stack

*   **Decision**:
    *   **Language**: Python 3.11
    *   **HTTP Library**: `requests`
    *   **Testing Framework**: `pytest`
*   **Rationale**: Python is a popular language for CLI tools with a rich ecosystem of libraries. The `requests` library is a simple and powerful HTTP client. `pytest` is a mature and feature-rich testing framework.
*   **Alternatives considered**: Go was considered, but Python was chosen for its simplicity and the extensive availability of libraries.

### Performance Goals

*   **Decision**: MCP interactions should have a response time of less than 500ms for p95.
*   **Rationale**: This provides a good user experience for a CLI tool.
*   **Alternatives considered**: A stricter goal of 200ms was considered but deemed unnecessary for the initial implementation.

### Constraints

*   **Decision**: Credentials will be stored securely in the user's home directory with restricted permissions.
*   **Rationale**: This is a standard practice for storing sensitive information.
*   **Alternatives considered**: Storing credentials in plaintext was rejected as it is insecure.
