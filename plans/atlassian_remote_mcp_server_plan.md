Based on the document "Getting started with the Atlassian Remote MCP Server"[1], here is a plan to implement the instructions:

### **Phase 1: Preparation and Prerequisites**

1.  **Verify Atlassian Cloud Access**: Ensure you have an active Atlassian Cloud site that includes Jira, Compass, and/or Confluence.[1]
2.  **Choose a Client**: Decide which supported tool you want to integrate with. Options include Gemini, IDEs like VS Code or Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others.[1]
3.  **Check System Requirements**:
    *   For IDEs and other local clients, you must have **Node.js v18+** installed on your system.[1]
    *   You will need a modern web browser to complete the authentication process.[1]

### **Phase 2: Setup and Configuration**

This phase depends on the type of client you chose in Phase 1.

#### **Path A: Cloud-Based Client (e.g., Gemini)**

1.  **Initiate Connection**: Follow the specific instructions for setting up Gemini, which will guide you through the cloud-based connection process.[1]
2.  **Authenticate via Browser**: You will be redirected to a browser to log in with your Atlassian account and authorize the connection via OAuth 2.1.[1]

#### **Path B: Local Client/IDE (e.g., VS Code, Cursor)**

1.  **Install the MCP Remote CLI**: Use Node.js to install the `mcp-remote` proxy tool. This is required for local clients to communicate with the Atlassian MCP Server.[1]
2.  **Run the Local Proxy**: Start the `mcp-remote` proxy on your local machine.[1]
3.  **Configure Your IDE**: Set up your IDE (e.g., VS Code) to connect to the local proxy.[1]
4.  **Authenticate via Browser**: The proxy will open a browser window for you to log in and authorize the connection with your Atlassian account.[1]

### **Phase 3: Verification and Usage**

1.  **Test the Integration**: After completing the setup, verify the connection by running a test command from within your client. For example:
    *   **Jira**: "Find all open bugs in Project Alpha."[1]
    *   **Confluence**: "Summarize the Q2 planning page."[1]
2.  **Explore Workflows**: Once the connection is verified, you can begin using the integration in your daily tasks. Refer to the "Example Workflows" section of the documentation for ideas on how to interact with Jira, Confluence, and Compass.[1]

### **Phase 4: Administration and Maintenance (For Admins)**

1.  **Manage User Access**: Ensure that team members have the necessary product access in Atlassian Admin.[1]
2.  **Monitor Usage**: Be aware of the beta access limits, which are higher for Premium/Enterprise plans.[1]
3.  **Revoke Access if Needed**: Users can revoke token access via their profile settings, and admins can manage app authorizations in Atlassian Admin.[1]
